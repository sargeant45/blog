title: Outrage Culture
---

"Outrage culture" is a term used to describe the Internet phenomena that is people getting offended about everything just for the sake of being offended or stirring up controversy/attention. For example, [Gamergate](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gamergate_controversy), [Shirtstorm](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/shirtstorm),  and anything from a famous playwright saying that Shakespeare sucks to not being able to play as a female (or, rarely, as a male) in "x" video game.

Many people say this "newfound" outrage culture is a result of the Internet. Many people argue that and say it's at the fault of this generation being the "stupidest." As a wise Papa Franku once said:

> I believe there have always been stupid people, but the Internet has made it easier for stupidity to be expressed and paraded.

Take this example of a typical outrage culture tweet:

> OMG PEOPLE ARE MAD AT MAD MAX FOR BEING TOO FEMININE SOMEBODY HAS AN OPINION OTHER THAN MINE THAT'S FUCKED UP GET THE HELL OUT MISOGYNIST BASTARDS #maxgate

Let's say that the media has already capitalized on this "outrage" and has already reported it in some open letter on The Huffington Post. That exposes the "outrage" and then the snowball effect of social media begins. One person you follow posts about it, and then you post about it, then your followers will see it and a few might repost it or create their own post. Congratulations, a trending hashtag has been born. After a while, everyone is posting about this "outrage" and the people who log on to Twitter or Facebook will see it everywhere, which just keeps the snowball effect rolling.

Now why am I posting about this? It pisses me off (ironic, isn't it). Outrage culture is stupid. We all need to think about something and get educated about it, instead of freaking out because we're scared, because there's no reason to freak out just because we're scared. A good example was the "Ebola crisis in America." The "Ebola crisis in America" was built entirely on social media and mainstream media coverage, based on a handful of American individuals who had contracted Ebola somewhere in Africa and carried it to the States.

"It will spread," people shouted, "I don't want to get Ebola!"

I know what you're probably thinking: "Ethan, there's a reason to be scared. It's a deadly disease!"

That's true, but the fact that 3 or 4 people in America have a disease that spread around in rural, dirty, poor Africa through bodily fluids doesn't mean that it will spread to the rest of the country. All of the scariness doesn't stem out of facts, but out of plain old media controversy stirring and fear (by the way, facts show that Ebola wouldn't survive for more than a few weeks here in the States, which is accurate considering that Ebola didn't survive in the States for more than a week or two).

From autism stemming from vaccines, a male wearing a shirt with cartoon women on it, video game journalism, Ebola, to a playwright who doesn't like Shakespeare, outrage culture is everywhere. So remember, before you get all pissed off about that outrageous new trend, remember Ethan Arterberry's six-hundred sixty-sixth rule of the Internet:

"Don't be a dipshit."
