title: About "No Offense"
---

"No Offense" is an attempt at being able to express my feelings to people other than my friends. Because at some point, my friends get really fucking tired of hearing my rants and raves bidaily. I'm Ethan Arterberry. I'm a [coder](https://github.com/sargeant45). I used to make videos. I used to experiment with some mixing of musics. I like the Internet. If you've seen my [website](http://ethanarterberry.com) then you basically know all there is to know about me.

Except the fact that I have an opinion on everything. That new movie that came out. That old Eminem album *Slim Shady LP* (which by the way, is one of my favorite albums of all time). The Apple Watch. Post avant jazzcore. Toothpaste. You name it.
